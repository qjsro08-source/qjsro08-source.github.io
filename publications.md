### 🏛️ R&D Projects

**1. Real-time User Identification Pipeline using Ear-EEG**
* **Agency:** ETRI (Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute)
* **Period:** 2025 (Project 2)
* **Description:**
  * **End-to-End Pipeline:** Developed a user identification pipeline utilizing a custom deep learning model trained on a our EEG dataset.
  * **Real-time Demo:** Implemented a web-based demonstration system that processes Ear-EEG signals, runs the deep learning inference, and identifies the user in real-time.
  * **System Integration:** Successfully integrated the hardware (Ear-EEG measurement) with the software (DL model & Web interface) for seamless operation.

**2. Large-scale EEG Database Construction based on Visual Stimuli**
* **Agency:** ETRI (Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute)
* **Period:** 2024 (Project 1)
* **Description:**
  * **Data Collection:** Recruited over 50 participants to collect high-quality EEG data in response to various visual stimuli (e.g., flash images, background images).
  * **Analysis:** Analyzed individual EEG signal variations corresponding to specific audiovisual triggers.
  * **Database:** Constructed a standardized, personalized EEG dataset utilized for training robust identification models.
